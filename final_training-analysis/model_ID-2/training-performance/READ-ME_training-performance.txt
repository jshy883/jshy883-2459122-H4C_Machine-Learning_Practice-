The '.hdf5' file contains numerical performance data returned after each training epoch. It has the following attributes: ['units', 'description', 'link']. The structure of the file is below: 

            Group - 'training-loss' : loss is unitless (as a result of binary cross-entropy/log loss)
                dataset - 'det_real' : contains the detector loss at each epoch from the REAL training set
                dataset - 'det_fake' : contains the detector loss at each epoch from the FAKE training set (grabbed from generator at each epoch)
                dataset - 'det_validation' : contains the detector loss at each epoch from the REAL validation set (data that is not used to train)
                dataset - 'gan_fake' : contains the GAN loss at each epoch from the FAKE training set that is paired with REAL flags (for GAN training)
            
            Group - 'training-accuracy' : accuracy is unitless (fraction of correctly identified inputs divided by total number of inputs in batch)
                dataset - 'det_real' : contains the detector accuracy at each epoch from the REAL training set
                dataset - 'det_fake' : contains the detector accuracy at each epoch from the FAKE training set (grabbed from generator at each epoch)
                dataset - 'det_validation' : contains the detector accuracy at each epoch from the REAL validation set (data that is not used to train)

The plots within this directory are graphical representations of the data described above. 
The REAL training and validation set losses/accuracies are paired together on plots to check for divergence that could signify overfitting.
