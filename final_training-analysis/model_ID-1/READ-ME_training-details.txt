HERA Auto-Correlation GAN Training Run ID-1 
Time of Execution: 08/09/2021 12:51:46 
Code written and ran by Joseph C. Shy 
Code executed from Commit - 3871007c7b39f3c55ce264edac4f6beaf5d6af6b. Neural Network inputs are documented below. 

The folder 'training-snapshots' contains random generator output every 50 epochs. 
The folder 'training-performance' shows various losses and accuracies of the model training. They can be used to analyze the validity and fit of the models created.

Data and Code Version Reference 
--------------------------------
The notebook used to generate this model is 'HERA-GAN_joseph-shy_memo'.
The auto-correlation ("ee") training set was randomly chosen from all good antennas flagged on the night of 2459122 for all integration time files located in the H4C directory in HERA lustre. 
Reference the text files in the parent directory for filepaths to auto-correlation data and good/bad antenna categorization.
The training set is grabbed from '2459122_good_auto-corrs_train.npy'.
The validation set is grabbed from '2459122_good_auto-corrs_valid.npy'.
The test set is grabbed from '2459122_good_auto-corrs_test.npy'.
All `REAL` data is input with median normalization applied.
To create the '.npy' files mentioned above, refer to 'download-training-data_joseph-shy_HERA-GAN.ipynb' jupyter notebook.


Training/Model Comments 
-----------------------
This is a training run of the auto-correlation training on the "ee" data from night of 2459122.
It is a final run, using the median pre-processing technique. 
Please refer to 'HERA-GAN_joseph-shy_memo.ipynb' jupyter notebook for details into the model architectures/hyperparameters.
 

Training Input Parameters: 
--------------------------
Latent Dimensions = 22 
Frequency Channels = 1536 
Total Epochs in this run = 10000 
Batch Size = 128 
Gan-to-Detector Training Ratio per Epoch = 1 

The '.h5' files contain the final models and their weights after the last epoch of training. The directory, 'model-save' contains trained models from every 500 epochs (in case future work is done with intermediate models or model overfits after a certain amount of epochs), but it is not tracked in the Github associated. 
The '*_summary.txt' files are the summaries of the layers of each model seen as a result of the command 'model.summary()'. 
The '*_visual.png' files are the flow chart plots of the layers of each model. It is helpful, as it includes the input shape of each model (while the '*_summary.txt' does not). The flow chart for the GAN is not present, as it its architecture is not compatible with the function that produces the visuals. 

All directories (aside from 'model-save') contain their own READ-ME files.
